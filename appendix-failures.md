# Appendix: Civic Tech Failures & Case Studies

This appendix documents real-world examples where public-sector digital systems failed to serve the public interest. These failures often reflect patterns of opaque procurement, vendor lock-in, cost overruns, or misaligned incentives — not just technical issues.

Each example is listed with a short summary. Where possible, a source link is provided to support the record. More references will be added progressively.

## What We've Learned

These failures reveal consistent patterns across jurisdictions and technologies:

- **Procurement favors the familiar** — Governments often choose legacy vendors over modern, open alternatives.

- **Opacity invites failure** — Without public accountability or visibility, overspending and underdelivery go unchecked.

- **Vendor lock-in reduces flexibility** — Systems become difficult to update, audit, or adapt.

- **Citizens pay the price** — Whether through lost access, financial hardship, or lost trust in public systems.

- **Digital systems must be resilient, inclusive, and inspectable** — Otherwise, they replicate offline inequities at scale.

This is why CivicPress insists on transparency, openness, local control, and civic-first design principles.
