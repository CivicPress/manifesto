# 🧭 CivicPress Governance

CivicPress is a public infrastructure project — and like all public systems, it should evolve in the open.

---

## 🤝 Current Structure

This project is currently maintained by the CivicPress founding team.  
Decisions around scope, priorities, and publishing are made collaboratively, with input from contributors and community allies.

---

## 🌱 Future Governance

As CivicPress grows, we aim to establish a shared governance model that may include:

- A non-profit foundation or cooperative structure
- A contributor charter and voting rights
- Advisory roles for municipal staff, technologists, and citizens

If you’re interested in helping shape CivicPress governance, let us know:

We believe civic software should be guided by civic values — and that includes how it’s run.
