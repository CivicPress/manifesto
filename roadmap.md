# CivicPress Roadmap

This roadmap defines the key phases of CivicPress development.
It favors clarity and steady progress over artificial deadlines — because civic software should be built to last.

---

## 🎯 Milestone 1 – Foundations & Vision

- [X] Publish the manifesto and appendix (English & French)
- [X] Launch public forms to invite contributors
- [X] Create GitHub organization and initial repositories
- [X] Define the project's goals and scope

---

## 🧩 Milestone 2 – Core Platform (MVP)

- [ ] Build the first two modules:
  - [ ] `public-sessions` (agendas, livestreams, minutes archive)
  - [ ] `legal-register` (bylaws and legal documents)
- [ ] Define content formats: Markdown + CSV/YAML
- [ ] Launch a minimal, bilingual public website

_Note: The technical architecture of CivicPress is evolving in the open._  
_We’re prioritizing clarity, simplicity, and modularity — and we welcome thoughtful input._

---

## 🧪 Milestone 3 – Test & Refine

- [ ] Deploy a working test instance (real or fictional municipality)
- [ ] Upload example data: council sessions, budgets, bylaws
- [ ] Test the full publishing workflow: edit → moderate → publish
- [ ] Collect internal and early community feedback

---

## 🚀 Milestone 4 – Pilot Launch

- [ ] Identify 1–2 municipalities for real-world deployment
- [ ] Package the platform for installation (GitHub template or script)
- [ ] Provide simple guides for clerks, staff, and tech teams

---

## 🌍 Milestone 5 – Community Growth

- [ ] Open contributions for modules, languages, and civic tools
- [ ] Develop initial governance structure (working group, nonprofit, or cooperative)
- [ ] Translate core materials into additional languages

_While community growth is a later milestone, contributors are welcome now._  
_Designers, developers, clerks, and writers — CivicPress needs your voice early._

---

CivicPress grows slowly, on purpose. We believe public software should be built like public infrastructure: openly, honestly, and with care.
